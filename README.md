# SIWES Training Projects

## Description
A collection of console and desktop applications developed during my
4-month SIWES industrial training program.

-------------
📘 Project Overview
-------------
During my 4-month SIWES training, I worked extensively with VB.NET to develop a series of desktop applications, starting from basic console programs to fully interactive Windows Forms applications. The goal of the training was to strengthen my programming logic, user interface design skills, and understanding of event-driven programming in the .NET environment.

This hands-on experience helped me gain practical knowledge in solving real-world problems using VB.NET and building applications that interact with data, files, and users.
